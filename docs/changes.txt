    +  Deck code is now executed by being compiled into Perl code and
       run by the Perl interpreter.  This should significantly improve
       performance.  The new command-line argument '--show-perl' will
       print the generated Perl code.

    +  Deck now defines local variables at the start of a procedure,
       regardless of the location of the 'var' statement as documented
       in manual.pod.  (It's still an error to use a variable before
       its declaration, however.)

    +  Struct-derived classes are no longer prevented from sharing a
       a variable name with an ancestor.

    +  Returns ('return' and 'next') are now instances of the new
       class 'Continuation'.

    +  Slight changes to built-in procedures 'lookup' and 'defined'.

    +  Added rudimentary backtrace capability.

    +  Lots of internal cleanup.

    +  Now supports module docstrings.

    +  Library docs are now complete.  (A bug in the docstring system
       was losing a lot of them.)
