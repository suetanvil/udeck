=head1 Deck Library Reference

This is the reference manual for the Deck System Library.  The System
Library currently consists of all built-in objects (specifically,
procedures, macros, mprocs and classes) defined by the Deck
interpreter or in the module C<Lang.dk>.  It does B<not> document the
Deck language itself.  For that, see the Reference Manual.

The manual itself is generated by the utility C<print_docstrings.dk>
from the docstrings of the various objects being documented.  There is
nothing new here that can't be found by reading the source code.
However, this manual puts it all in one place.

Names beginning with C<_::> (i.e. belonging to the C<_> namespace) are
internal to the system.  B<You should never use them.>  They are
documented here to satisfy any curiousity you might have and because
you may occasionally run into system-generated code that uses them.
