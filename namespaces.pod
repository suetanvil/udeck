=head1 Namespaces

Namespaces are delimited by '::', e.g. 'Namespace::subname::var'.

$Globals maintains a reference to the current namespace.  Unqualified
globals are automatically put there.

Should we be allowed to define names in other namespaces?
X	-yes! Macros need it.
X	-but! you can't switch namespaces inside a file.
X		-the 'use' statement sets it--the 'package' declaration just
X	     asserts it.  but it's mandatory(?).

Namespace variables beginning with '_' are private -- the system
refuses to look them up in qualified names and they are not imported.

Namespaces can be imported.  This copies all public namespace entries
to the current namespace (unless this is controlled somehow.)  Imports
may not override an existing name; hence, the first one wins.

The import statement allows selective importing and renaming:

    use VectorMath
    use VectorMath with {add subtract eigenValue}
    use VectorMath without {multiply divide}
	use VectorMath with {add -> plus; subtract -> minus; eigenValue}

Predefined namespaces:

	Main			-- Default namespace.
	Lang			-- Language features; automatically imported.
	Lang::*			-- Reserved.
	_::*			-- Reserved. Implementation-defined system functions.
	__::*			-- Reserved. mproc functions go here.


=head2 Importing

	-the 'use' statement plus package path determines the filename to load.
		-but the package loaded MUST, as its first statement, contain a 'package'
		 declaration with a matching name.
	-the load path is a simple global list in Main called LoadPath.



=head2 To-do

	-let symbols include '::'.

	-create a subclass of LL::Context for the global context.
	-add a default namespace.  This gets used for all unqualified sets
	 and lookups.
	-add builtins in '_' to access them.

=head2 Questions

X	-Should namespaces be declared before use?
X		-yes
