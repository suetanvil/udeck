=head1 The Object System

=head2 Thoughts

I'm not going to try to implement the object system in pure Deck.
You're welcome.

For now, builtin types (list, string, etc.) are not OOPS.  That will
change.

Objects are a special type.

Classes are also a special type.  They are also callable and create
instances, then call 'INIT' with their arguments.

Let's use 'new' to create instances.  There's no real advantage to
making classes callable.

I'm not going to use the Perl object system until I have a better
grasp of everything.
