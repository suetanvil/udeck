=head1 The Object System

=head2 Thoughts

I'm not going to try to implement the object system in pure Deck.
You're welcome.

For now, builtin types (list, string, etc.) are not OOPS.  That will
change.

Objects are a special type.

Classes are also a special type.  They are also callable and create
instances.  Specifically, they call 'INIT' with their arguments.
